# csce331-cfa-pos-system Project 2 Phase 3 Iteration
In phase 3 of project 2, we implemented a low level graphical interface that interacts with the databases we created in phase 2. This phase consist of 2 main parts, creating the customer and manager GUIs. Below we will explore what we implemented, and looking into how we will improve on our work in phase 4.

## Roles:
* Cole McAnelly - Cole created a Java scripts with functions that allowed the front end of the system to call to and update the database when needed. This was huge, as it allowed us to separate out our work and logic, as well as took away from redundent coding in our front end.

* Logan Kettle - Logan created the Customer Interface for our POS system. On the Customer side, people are allowed to choose menu items to create and order, and submit an order to the database. The Customer Interface also displays any new or updated values that the ManagerMenu interface creates

* Weston Cadena - Weston created the ManagerIngredient Interface. Here, the manager can see each ingredient item along with its current supply, and has the ability to update or order a new amount of the ingredient. The changes will be displayed both in the front end as well as in the database

* Ryan Paul - Ryan created the ManagerMenu Interface. Here, the manager can see each Menu Item along with its current cost, and has the ability to update or add a new item to the menu. The changes will be displayed both in the front end as well as in the database

## Whats Next 
In Phase Four, we are looking into adding onto our current system in order to make it more usable and advanced. In phase 4, we will add the ability to create graphs that will display trends over time of different menu items and ingredients. In addition, we will add onto our current menu, separating out each individual catagory (ex: breakfeast, dessert) and also add a seasonal item to the menu.
